## Pipeline

### Proprocess.py: function fill_median and fill_mean: Imputation is happening on the entire data set. Needs to be only on train set

### City,county, district shouldn’t be dropped，or at least decribe the reason to drop g them 

### Run the code on the donors choose problem

## Write up the results 4/10

### More description to required in the notebook: in 5.compare all the model, how and why? 

### Graphs 3 and 4 end at different places - they must be wrong 

## Writing needs to improve.
Readable

## Code quality: 4/10

### Suggestion in naming a file: processor.py -> data_process.py or preprocess.py

### Hard coded/Not reusable

### Repeated code: e.g.: line 78-106 in main.py, ev.precision_at_k(base_y_test_sorted,baseline_y_pred_probs_sorted,1.0)

### More comments required: For example, what is 'xs_lst' and what does it use for?
also, line 117-129: run_time_validation, what are the input arguments? Same for functions in time_validate.py~
